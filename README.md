# 🌿 Species Identification and Coverage Estimation from Ground-level Imagery for Vegetation Monitoring 📷
This repository contains the data and code used in __Müller, Puliti, and Breidenbach (2025)__ to train and apply deep learning models for __species coverage estimation__ using ground-level imagery.

It includes: 

✅ A YOLOv8 object detection model for detecting frames in images and one species instance segmentation model for species identification and identifying and segmenting species.

✅ Method to parse instance segmentation masks to species-specific coverage estimates in images.

✅ The data used to train and evaluate the models. The full datasets can be downloaded in this Zenodo repository https://zenodo.org/records/13361905

# 👩‍🚀 Workflow Overview
This demo provides a step-by-step approach for training and applying the models:

1️⃣ __Training:__
- Train two models using labeled images:
  -   __Frame Object Detection__ (dataset: Frame_data)
  -   __Species Instance Segmentation__ (dataset: Species_segmentation_data)
 
2️⃣ __Confidence Optimization:__
- Optimize the confidence threshold based on downstream __cover estimation__ performance.

3️⃣ __Inference:__
- Predict on test images (Species_cover_data_test).

4️⃣ __Evaluation:__
- Compare predictions with field estimates (Field_data_NFI).


📌 The code has been tested on a Windows machine and Python 3.10.
