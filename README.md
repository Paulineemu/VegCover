# Species Identification and Coverage Estimation from Ground-level Imagery for Vegetation Monitoring 
This repo includes a script to train a YOLO frame detection model and a YOLO species segmentation model based on labelled ground-level imagery. 
Additionally, the script includes a function to use these two models to estimate the percentage coverage per species.
